                  <li>Little Story: In April of 2015 I had been working on a project with just one other developer. He did the backend (ruby on rails) and I did the front end with ReactJS. One day after lunch, the backend engineer didn't come back. He emailed in to our boss saying that he was quitting. The next day my boss came to me and said "Derek we don't have any engineers to spare on your project, so you'll be in charge of the backend as well." I had never written a line of Ruby code at that point and suddenly was in charge of an app that was having critical issues in production. With little guidance at work. I eventually learned the ins-and-outs of Ruby and Rails to be fully trusted to refactor significant portions of that project. And then after a little time later I started working on the 4 other applications we have. The moral of the story is, I learn fast.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Sidekiq</li>
                <ul><li>Writing Sidekiq workers and cron jobs to make async API calls or other tasks.</li></ul>
